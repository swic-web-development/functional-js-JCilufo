### Functions Inside Variables and Arrow Functions
- How to store functions inside of variables and how to shorten it by using the arrow function
- I know I will most likely see both in the field so it is important to learn both ways of writing functions
- If there is only one statement in the function body, and it's a return statement, then it can be shortened to one line of code

### Callback Functions
- Callback functions get passed to another function and are executed later
- Other programming languages do not treat functions as first class citizens
- Modern JavaScript approach of array processing

### Map Method
- The `map` method can be applied to an array to alter its values as a callback function and make a new array with the altered values
- `map` is more powerful and flexible than `forEach`
- The `map` method iterates over every element in the array without any specification needed
- We will see an array of undefined if we don't specify a return function

### JS with a Dash of HTML
- The `map` method can be used to take raw data and put it into HTML format for the browser to render
- I learned that's a big part of what front end developers do.
- It's important to remember to use `join("")` or `join("\n")` to make the table layout more presentable
